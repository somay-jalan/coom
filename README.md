# COOM Training Framework

## Overview
A training framework for large-scale language models based on Megatron-Core, the COOM Training Framework is designed to efficiently handle extensive model training inspired by Deepseek's HAI-LLM optimizations. 

This framework is planned to support state-of-the-art innovations essential for achieving high-performance language modeling, particularly targeting efficiency and scalability for large models.

## Key Objectives
- Develop an optimized pretraining framework based on Deepseek's HAI-LLM.
- Enable efficient scaling of large multilingual language models.
- Incorporate cutting-edge optimizations to maximize training efficiency.
